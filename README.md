# Camden Music Buddies

## What is this?
Camden Music Buddies is Team Kansas and Braccia's project for Human Computer Interaction (CSCE 378). It is meant to be an application to play music from all platforms you are subscribed to, even if a song is exclusive to only one of the platforms. This is the computer prototype built using Vue.

## Tasks
1. Play the song “Dreamland” by Chills from Spotify on the Home screen.
2. Add the song “Red Eyes” by Chills to the playlist “Cool Songs”.
3. Go to playlist “Cool Songs” and play the song “Red Eyes” by Chills.
4. While “Red Eyes” is playing, search for the song “Number 15” by Chills from YouTube, add it to the queue, and skip to that song.
